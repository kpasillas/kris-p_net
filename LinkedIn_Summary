LinkedIn Summary (3/23/19)

Having grown up in Southern California I've always had an appreciation for what a special place it is, but I also knew the world was a much bigger place. My goal in picking a major in college was not to set myself upon a specific career path but to choose a subject that would keep open as many doors as possible.

As a Peace Corps Volunteer in Swaziland I learned that you didn't need a background in medicine or public health to be effective as a health project manager. Instead, you needed to recognize what you didn't know and then use the things you did know to find solutions. I've carried this humbling experience with me as I've transitioned from the public health to the technology field.

Since I took my first computer science class two years ago I've been warned repeatedly by professors and experienced professionals of the frustration, dedication, and borderline-obsession that seems inherent in the lifestyle of a software developer. While I think about these warnings every time I get stuck wrestling with some bug in an assignment for class or reporting tool at work, I can honestly say there are few things I've experienced that are as satisfying as finding a solution.

I pride myself on my diverse work and life experience. While not having the typical background for some of these positions may have been an obstacle at first, I believe my work ethic is stronger because of it. I enter these new opportunities with an open mind, excited to learn something new while bringing a unique perspective to the table.

I want to build something. At the end of the day I want to see a product, whether that's something I can hold in my hand or knowing I helped somebody else.
